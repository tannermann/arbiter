Were it so easy.

This is a learning project to practice building apps with Electron and oAuth. I have no intention of anyone actually using this project.

Milestones:
1. [WIP] Basic functioning Electron app with Prettier and Github setup
2. Build a simple non-functioning sign-up page
3. Hook up user creation flow to a DB
4. Create login flow using oAuth
5. Halo quote of the day
6. Halo image/video of the day
7. More to come...
